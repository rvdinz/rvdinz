I'm really into coding and love working with anything related to the hosting industry. Iâ€™m especially into server stuff and managing how things run behind the scenes.

Currently, I'm a manager at **[XA Hosting](https://xahosting.co)** - This is a company that offers reliable and high-performance hosting solutions.
