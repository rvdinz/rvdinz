# 🚀 Rvdinz/Rudin

I'm really into coding and love working with anything related to the hosting industry. I’m especially into server stuff and managing how things run behind the scenes.

Currently, I'm working at **[Plodium](https://plodium.com)** - We offer fast, secure, and dependable server solutions for people who demand performance without compromise.
